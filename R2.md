# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 21: Monday, June 22, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: 

- I successfuly fetched the data from the Open Weather API.
- I filtered through the data returned, to display the forecast for the next 5 days.
- Also mapped through the state to return a DailyCard component for each day of the week.

**Thoughts:** 
- Today I realized that I am missing a key part of the app, which is a search bar that allows you to enter a zipcode. I will be using React Router to implement this feature. The app's initial load up will be a simple screen with a search input. Once you enter your zipcode and search, it will load the WeeklyContainer component which shows the 5 day forecast.

### Day 22: Tuesday, June 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
  
- I added the Search feature that takes in a zipcode
- Learned how to make routes & change routes 

**Thoughts:**
- The search input is missing form validation. I am also using this time to practice my CSS skills. I will make a very beautiful weather app ðŸ˜Ž
