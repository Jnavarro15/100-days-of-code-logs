# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 11: Sunday, May 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
  
- I started building my Pokémon app today! I created the Context.Provider that will pass all our data to our components.
- I also read through the PokéAPI documentation to understand more about how the API works.
- I created two of my main Components the PokemonList and Pokedex.

**Thoughts:**
- I realized today that this project isn't going to be as easy as I origanlly predicted. This is awesome because I love a challenge. I will complete this project without reffering to a tutorial. I will only use Google and documentation to help me throughout this project!

### Day []: [day], May [], 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
