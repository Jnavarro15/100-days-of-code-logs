# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 21: Monday, June 22, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: 

- I successfuly fetched the data from the Open Weather API.
- I filtered through the data returned to display the 5 day forecast.
- Also mapped through the state to return a DailyCard component for each day of the week.

**Thoughts:** 
- Today I realized that I am missing a key part of the app, which is a search bar that allows you to enter a zipcode. I will be using React Router to implement this feature. The app's initial load up will be a simple screen with a search input. Once you enter your zipcode and search, it will load the WeeklyContainer component which shows the 5 day forecast.
