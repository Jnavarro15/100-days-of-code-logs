# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 11: Sunday, May 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
  
- I started building my Pokémon app today! I created the Context.Provider that will pass all our data to our components.
- I also read through the PokéAPI documentation to understand more about how the API works.
- I created two of my main Components the PokemonList and Pokedex.

**Thoughts:**
- I realized today that this project isn't going to be as easy as I origanlly predicted. This is awesome because I love a challenge. I will complete this project without reffering to a tutorial. I will only use Google and documentation to help me throughout this project!

### Day [21]: Monday, June 22, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: 

- I successfuly fetched the data from the Open Weather API.
- I filtered through the data returned to display the 5 day forecast.
- Also mapped through the state to return a DailyCard component for each day of the week.

**Thoughts:** 
- Today I realized that I am missing a key part of the app, which is a search bar that allows you to enter a zipcode. I will be using React Router to implement this feature. The app's initial load up will be a simple screen with a search input. Once you enter your zipcode and search, it will load the WeeklyContainer component which shows the 5 day forecast.
